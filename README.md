# Open Wine Initiative

The Open Wine Initiative is a small community devloted to openness in the world of wine. The group is intended for ideation, social inclusiviity and objective consideration. The [Open Wine Project]() is a collection of data catalogs, ontologies, tools and more organized to support this effort.

While the community, data and tools are all open source, the effort is intended to make commercial use cases more efficient and consistent so various participants can plan better, plant better, grow better and taste better! 

These are living documents and welcome community members to join to participate by emailing openwineproject@googlegroupsl.com.
